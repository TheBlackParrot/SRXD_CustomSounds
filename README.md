# CustomSounds
**Replace Spin Rhythm XD's default sounds with your own!**

The mod will look in `Spin Rhythm/BepInEx/config/CustomSounds` for custom sound packs. Restart the game if you add or remove sound pack folders while the game is running.

Changing sound packs while in-game is supported via the added Mod Settings page. Entering *Default* as the active pack name will essentially disable the mod.

I've provided a few custom packs in the [Releases page](https://github.com/TheBlackParrot/SRXD_CustomSounds/releases).

## Dependencies
- SpinCore

## Pack setup
Create any of these sub-folders inside a folder within `Spin Rhythm/BepInEx/config/CustomSounds`:

> [!NOTE]
> All folders are optional, defaults will be used if the folder is not present.
